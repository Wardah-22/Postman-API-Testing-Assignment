# Assignment 1 - Postman API Testing

## 📋 Description
This repository contains a Postman collection that demonstrates the use of various API testing methods, assertions, and scripting capabilities. It is a part of an academic assignment.

## ✅ Objectives Covered

- ✅ Used all major HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`
- ✅ Set Base URL as a global/environment variable
- ✅ Generated random request body data using Postman scripts
- ✅ Parsed JSON responses and logged values to the Postman Console
- ✅ Used Postman Chai Assertion Library for validating responses
- ✅ Created a deliberately failing assertion for testing negative scenarios
- ✅ Used Pre-request scripts to set variables and reset them in the Tests tab
- ✅ Used data from one API response as input to another API

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Import the `.postman_collection.json` file into Postman.
2. Import the environment file (if applicable).
3. Run the collection using Postman Collection Runner or manually test endpoints.


## 💡 Note

- The test case that fails is intentional to demonstrate assertion failure handling.
- Random data is generated using JavaScript in the Pre-request Script tab.
